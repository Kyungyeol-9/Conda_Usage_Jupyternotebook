I recommand package install process
1. find python package or googling package name in pyPI.
$ pip search [PACKAGE_NAME]
2. install python package 
$ pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]
#cause, similar package is existed. Module name is different between script and piPI frequently.

$ pip uninstall [PACKAGE_NAME]
# delete package in your conda env.
